# FoodOrderApp_TechCareer
"I've created an easy-to-use food ordering app. You can sign up or log in, add your favorite dishes to your list, and order them quickly. You can also check your past orders and update your profile. 
#
"My Android project uses a modern technology stack, including View Binding for efficient UI interactions, Coroutines for managing asynchronous tasks, ViewModel for UI data and lifecycle management, Navigation for streamlined screen transitions, Hilt for dependency injection, and Room for local data storage and database management. This stack ensures clean architecture, maintainability, and a seamless user experience. Additionally, we've integrated Retrofit for web service data retrieval, Glide for efficient image handling, and Firebase for user authentication and storage, further enhancing our app's capabilities and ensuring a smooth, feature-rich user experience.
